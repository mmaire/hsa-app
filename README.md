This repository contains minified latest versions of jDataView and jBinary libraries with source maps.

It's updated automatically by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) on each successful build *(success == passing all tests)*.

Those libraries can be used in own projects by including in [//jdataview.github.io/dist/jdataview.js](//jdataview.github.io/dist/jdataview.js) form as `<script src>`, using Require.JS or in any other form.
